## The Website
Temonet (**T**h**e** **Mo**ney **Net**work) is a personal website for posting scientific and technical articles on Bitcoin. The aim is to contribute towards the understading of the emerging technological sector/scientific field/economic system resulting from the global decentralized network adoption of Bitcoin. In the best case, Bitcoin adoption ushers in a paradigm shift that revolutionalizes money and how economies operate on a fundamental level. Under this scenario, brand new theories and knowledge tools will need to be developed to reorient the society. 

The articles published is classified into three broad categories
- Price: For articles dealing with finance/economics of Bitcoin. 
- PoW: For articles dealing with state of mining and network security.
- User: For articles dealing with user adoption.   

The site also tries to make use of interactive, (semi) live charts to enable a more rich user experience. Check out /Dashboard for live info on many key Bitcoin indicators. 

Also, when possible, links to source code of the tooling used will be published to Bitcoin-Power-Tools public repository. Search under the tag source-code to find all articles with published source code.  

## The Author
I am a highly science and technology oriented person. I have a PhD in Mechanical Engineering with specialization in Computational Dynamics [link to PhD dissertation] where I contributed towards building advanced mathematical and numerical models for simulating sound and vibration in novel materials and high tech instruments. I have 5+ years experience working in the worlds leading semiconductor manufacturing industry where I served in both the analyst and designer role. I am deeply fascinated with Bitcoin as a technology and its potential capacity towards revolutionizing money. What really pushed me towards starting writing on it was the realization that Bitcoin price follows a Power Law, a fact that has been rigoursly demonstrated by Giovanni Santostashi (who first discovered it) and several other prominent memebers in this space.
